# base64-encode-decode

Small prototype I implemented to learn about applying [`gpui`](https://www.gpui.rs/) and [`gpui-component`](https://github.com/longbridge/gpui-component) to implement a desktop application. The application is really simple, just type plain text or base64 text to encode/decode with state if it is valid and key binding to reset (Cmd+r).
